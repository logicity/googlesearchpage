This is a mini-project by Odinproject.com. It involves reconstructing google's searchpage. It was interesting and I learned a lot especially about postioning. It was difficult at first but then, am glad I could do it. It isn't a perfect page and you could help make it better afterall what is github for. If you wanna learn with someone just holler me at saintiykebrand@yahoo.com. Thanks.
